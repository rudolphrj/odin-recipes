        <h2>CLINKZ THE HERO</h2>
        <p>Clinkz is a unique hero that farms incredibly fast, provides strong dps
            (and control depending on the item build) in the mid-late to late game,
            has great slipperyness and mobility, as well as great range for highground defense
        and seiging.</p>
        <h3>Pros</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incredible farming speed as Pos 1 or 2.</li>
            <li>Very tanky due to your ultimate, BKB is often not required.</li>
            <li>Strong burst and sustained damage.</li>
            <li>Great waveclear combined with invis gives you slipperyness.</li>
            <li>Can play for late game teamfight damage or raid-boss style carry.</li>
            <li>Can opt for control build with skadi, gleipnir.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Takes a long time to come online.</li>
            <li>Not good at ganking or creating space.</li>
            <li>Vulnerable to BKB piercing spells during barrage.</li>
            <li>No escape if caught.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How to Play Clinkz</h1>
        <h2>Items and Skill Build</h2>
        <h3>Items</h3>
        <h4>Starting items</h4>
        <p>Start with 2x Iron branches, tangos, sages mask, and a fairy fire.
        </p>
        <h4>Item Build</h4>
        <p>Your first item will depend on how the lane is going.
            <ul>
                <li>If your lane <strong>sucks</strong>, rush brown boots , then
                    javelin. This will give you the best way to clear the wave
                    as well as farm jungle stacks that you will be making for
                    yourself. The brown boots allow you to stack ancients and
                    the hard camp every minute, while not losing too much lane
                    farm.</li>
                <li>If your lane is decent, you can upgrade your Sage's Mask
                    into a Falcon Blade. The mana regen is great, and Burning Barrage
                    doesn't immediately require a proc item to do strong damage. I prefer
                FB to treads as clinkz doesn't benefit as highly from the attack speed.</li>
                <li>If you are against a weak laner, treads and falcon blade before javelin
                    is a good choice. This gives you strong lane power while still being able to
                    farm, <em>a javelin is helpful but not necessary to clear camps and
                    waves!</em> After Treads and Falcon Blade, buy a Javelin.</li>
            </ul>
            After you have one of the above sets of items, <strong>you will always build
                Javelin and immediately upgrade it into Maelstrom.</strong>. Clinkz is very
            mana hungry and you will need to ship out clarities through the
            game, (especially in the laning stage).
            <p>Depending on the lane, you will pick up Magic Stick/Wand and raindrops.</p>
        </p>
        <p>After Maelstrom is completed, you can easily shove waves and farm ancient
            stacks. Pull the hard camp to the ancients and farm both at once
            with Burning Barrage. Ship out clarities to always have mana. Finish Treads if you
            haven't already.</p>
        <p>In the mid game your item build will generally go as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>After Treads and Maelstrom (and wand if needed), your next item
                will always be Dragon Lance.</li>
            <li>If your team is fighting, you can disassemble Dragon Lance into
                BKB, giving you a strong power spike. If done, I always buy the
                Ogre Club again to remake the Dragon Lance. Here you
                must decide if you need BKB. You do not necessarily need
            BKB against CC, as you are have Agh's shard archers and great
                range. Clinkz is susceptible to heavy magic damage however, thus
            a BKB purchase vs OD, zeus, timber, storm, void, etc. is often necessary.</li>
            <li>After Dragon Lance (and BKB if you bought it), your item build will start to diverge.
                Clinkz is a great Skadi carrier, and thus it should be bought versus ranged/healing cores.
                Sometimes your team has great setup and tankiness, and your only job is to
                fire Burning Barrage into the enemies. In this case, a Daedalus is your best buy.
                Another good all around choice is Orchid. Although not the ganker he used
                to be, the mana regen is great for farming and the silence can help you
            keep down slippery heroes in teamfight.</li>
            <li>After one of the aformentioned core items, I usually pick up Gleipnir.
                If you are far ahead (which you should be, you are Clinkz), then the
                root gives you some pick off potential versus underfarmed heroes (which there
                will be, as enemy supports need to invest in detection to stop
                you from clearing every wave and camp).</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
